## Tab Utility Chrome Extension
This app is used to create a pdf with urls of all the tabs opened in the window. <br><br>
<li> The code will take all the urls of the tabs opened, sort it alphabetically, trim the length, if required and add it to the PDF. 
<li> The PDF will contain at max of 27 tab urls. If the number exceeds, a new pdf page is added to the file.

<br>
 
The application can be downloaded and added to the chrome as extention. 

### How is the extension useful: 
<li> The extension will help save time to get the urls while closing the window. Just a click on the extension and we have all the urls, in sorted manner.
<li> It can also help to find the required sites in future, window-wise, a feature which can not be leveraged with chrome history.
